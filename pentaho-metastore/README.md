metastore
----------
This project contains a flexible metadata, data and configuration information store. 
Anyone can use it but it was designed for use within the Pentaho software stack.

The "meta-model" is simple and very generic.
The top level entry is always a namespace. The namespace can be used by non-Pentaho companies to store their own information separate from anyone else.

The next level in the meta-model is an Element Type.  A very generic name was chosen on purpose to reflect the fact that you can store just about anything.  The element is at this point in time nothing more than a simple placeholder: an ID, a name and a description.

Finally, each element type can have a series of Elements.  
Each element has an ID and a set of key/value pairs (called "id" and "value") as child attributes. All attributes can have children of their own.
An element has security information: an owner and a set of owner-permissions describing who has which permission to use the element. (CRUD permissions)

The hierarchy:
--------------

* Namespace
* Element Type
* Element
* Attributes


How to build
--------------

metastore uses the maven framework. 


#### Pre-requisites for building the project:
* Maven, version 3+
* Java JDK 1.8
* This [settings.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentaho/maven-parent-poms/master/maven-support-files/settings.xml) in your <user-home>/.m2 directory

#### Building it

This is a maven project, and to build it use the following command

```
$ mvn clean install
```
Optionally you can specify -Drelease to trigger obfuscation and/or uglification (as needed)

Optionally you can specify -Dmaven.test.skip=true to skip the tests (even though
you shouldn't as you know)

The build result will be a Pentaho package located in ```target```.

#### Running the tests

__Unit tests__

This will run all unit tests in the project (and sub-modules). To run integration tests as well, see Integration Tests below.

```
$ mvn test
```

If you want to remote debug a single java unit test (default port is 5005):

```
$ cd core
$ mvn test -Dtest=<<YourTest>> -Dmaven.surefire.debug
```

__Integration tests__

In addition to the unit tests, there are integration tests that test cross-module operation. This will run the integration tests.

```
$ mvn verify -DrunITs
```

To run a single integration test:

```
$ mvn verify -DrunITs -Dit.test=<<YourIT>>
```

To run a single integration test in debug mode (for remote debugging in an IDE) on the default port of 5005:

```
$ mvn verify -DrunITs -Dit.test=<<YourIT>> -Dmaven.failsafe.debug
```

To skip test

```
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

To get log as text file

```
$ mvn clean install test >log.txt
```


__IntelliJ__

* Don't use IntelliJ's built-in maven. Make it use the same one you use from the commandline.
  * Project Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven ==> Maven home directory
